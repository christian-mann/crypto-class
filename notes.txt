Important math
	Groups, rings
	XOR
	Finite fields
	Finite field ~ real numbers in terms of operations

	Cyclic group (prime modulus)
	Fermat's Little Theorem and implications

	P vs NP vs NP-Complete vs NP-Hard

	Probability?

Hashing
	Attacks
	TMTO
Public-key
	Diffie-Hellman
	ElGamal
	RSA
	Elliptic curve (honestly, this should be in-class)
Symmetric
	DES
	AES
SSL
	What happens if it gets broken?

Attacks (implementation)
	Single-byte XOR
	Caesar cipher
	Viginere
	Attack types (KPA, CPA, CCA, COA)
	CRIME
	BREACH
	ECB
	CBC (e.g. padding oracle)
		BEAST
	RSA
		Coppersmith
		Bleichenbacher

Attacks (cryptography)
	TMTO
	Baby Step / Giant Step

Format:
	The students should do a research topic / 15 min presentation of their own
		Bitcoin

		Differential Cryptanalysis
		ENIGMA
		Homomorphic
		Malleable
		Oblivious Transfer Protocol
		POODLE
		Perfect Forward Security
		Quantum Cryptography

		TOR: The Onion Router
		Timing Attacks
		Trusted computing
		WEP/WPA/Wifi
	Many proofs should be done by the students, walked through in homeworks

Why is a cryptosystem bad?
	- Repeated messages (esp. with same key)
	- Pro Forma messages
	- Not supporting all message types, leading to the above
