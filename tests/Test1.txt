Describe the difference between a stream cipher and a block cipher. Name a few
examples of each.

What is public-key vs private-key? When would you use each?

Define:
	Nonce
	Cipher
	Key (cryptovariable)
	Cryptosystem

Crack:
	Vigenere Cipher

Demonstrate:
	RSA
	Diffie-Hellman

What is a Feistel network? How can it be used to simplify the process of
creating a cipher?

What is wrong with the below cipher? How can it be exploited? How difficult
would it be to crack?

What is the purpose of a nonce? Describe its use in a cryptosystem.

For each of the following modes describe the result of changing one bit in block
c_1 on the current decrypted block and subsequent blocks.
	ECB
	CBC
	PCBC
	CFB
	OFB
	CTR

Given are two protocols in which the sender performs the following operation:
For each of these, describe what steps the receiver performs upon receipt of a
message.
State which of 1) Confidentiality, 2) Integrity, 3) Non-repudiation are offered.

Given the below systems, give an adversary that achieves a high PRF-advantage,
if possible.
Calculate the advantage achieved.
	Shift:
		Domain: {0,1}^32
		Range: {0,1}^32
		procedure Initialize
			K <-$- {0, 1, 2, ... 31}
		
		procedure Fn(x)
			for i in range(32):
				y[i] = x[(i + K) mod 32]
	
	XOR:
		Domain: {0,1}^32
		Range: {0,1}^32
		procedure Initialize
			K <-$- {0,1}^32

		procedure Fn(x)
			return x xor K
	
	Append:
		Domain: {0,1}^32
		Range: {0,1}^96
		procedure Initialize
			K <-$- {0,1}^64

		procedure Fn(x)
			return concat(x, K)
