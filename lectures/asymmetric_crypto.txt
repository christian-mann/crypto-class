Re-iterate Fermat's Little Theorem

What elements are invertible mod(p)?
	Everything except [0] = [p]
What elements are invertible mod(n)?
	Given a, find b s.t. ab == 1 (mod n)

	ab + kn = 1

	This is possible only if gcd(a, n) == 1

	So every element that is coprime to n has an inverse

Particularly (say this, don't prove it): These elements form a group
structure, in an analogous way to the prime group

Soooo we can make the same argument as before:
	{x_1, x_2, x_3, ..., x_tot(n)}

	is equivalent mod n to

	{ax_1, ax_2, ax_3, ..., ax_tot(n)}

	So multiplying:

	prod(x_i, i, 0, tot(n)) == prod(a x_i, i, 0, tot(n))
	prod(x_i, i, 0, tot(n)) == a^tot(n) * prod(x_i, i, 0, tot(n))

	Cancelling requires that gcd(a, n) == 1:

	1 == a^tot(n) (mod n)

	Incidentally, there is a separate proof that

	a ^ (tot(n) + 1) == a (mod n)

	which works regardless of greatest common divisor

Demonstration
	n = 10 = 2 * 5
	tot(n) = (2-1) (5-1) = 4

	Take a coprime digit d (either 3, 7, or 9) and show that d ^ 4 == 1 (mod 10)

	Take any digit d, and show that d ^ (4 + 1) == d (mod 10)

We can use this:
	C = m ^ e (mod n)
	M = C ^ d (mod n) = m ^ ed (mod n)

	We need m ^ ed == m (mod n)

	We let ed == 1 (mod tot(n)); i.e. e = d^-1 (mod tot(n))

	So
	m ^ ed = m ^ (k tot(n) + 1)
	       = m ^ k tot(n) * m
	       = 1 * m
	       = m
	
How to compute the totient, though?
	For prime, tot(p) = p-1
	This reduces the above formula to FLT

	Easy if you know the prime factorization

	There exists a proof (that I don't want to get into) that
	tot(p1 p2) = (p1 - 1) (p2 - 1)

	We don't know a better way to compute totient than factoring N
	We are /pretty sure/ that factoring is hard
		However, it's not *impossible* -- we'll get to that later

	So the prime factorization of N is the trapdoor.

So now we do an example

	p = 11
	q = 13
	n = 143
	tot(n) = 10 * 12 = 120

	Let e = 7 (just needs to be coprime with n -- 3 is often chosen)
	Then d = e^-1 (mod tot(n)) = 103

	m = 9
	C = m^e (mod n) = 9^7 (mod 143) = 48
	M = m^d (mod n) = 48 ^ 103 (mod 143) = 9 = m
