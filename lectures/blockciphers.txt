KR-security


Block cipher: Family of permutations on chunk, indexed by key
	E_K: {0,1}^l -> {0,1}^l is a permutation
	E_K, E_K^-1 are efficient

	Also expressible as E: {0,1}^k x {0,1}^l -> {0,1}^l

Example of a block cipher is XOR, if k == l

To use a block cipher:
	K randomly chosen from {0,1}^k, the keyspace
	K distributed to trusted parties (only)
	A, B use E_K and E_K^-1

	E is public



Key-recovery security game:

- Key is selected, not given to A
- A can submit plaintext M and get back C, as many times as desired
- A outputs guess K'
- A wins if K' is correct


Security requirements:
	COA: Ciphertext-only
	KPA: Known-plaintext
		Crib: Synonym
		Kiss: Transmitting same message plain and encrypted
	CPA: Chosen-plaintext
		CPA: Batch chosen-plaintext
		CPA2: Adaptive
	CCA: Chosen-ciphertext
		CCA1: Lunchtime attack
		CCA2: Adaptive, can't query target ciphertext
	
	There are others, having to do with integrity. We won't talk about those at
	the moment.
