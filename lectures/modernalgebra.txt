Sets
Relations as subsets of S x S
	We say x R y if (x,y) \in R
	Example: x = y
	Example: x > y
	Example: x R y if y = 3

Functions as subset of S x S
	If (x1, y1) \in f and (x1, y2) \in f then y1 = y2
	We say f(x1) = y1
One-to-one, onto
	One-to-one: If f(x1) = f(x2) then x1 = x2
	f: A -> B is onto B: for each y in B, there exists an x in A s.t. f(x) = y
		It hits all points in its codomain
Invertible functions
	If a function is one-to-one and onto, it is invertible

Operations, Cayley Tables
	Operation is a function S x S -> S
		We write a * b for operation
		Sometimes a + b
		Or sometimes just ab
	Associativity
		(a * b) * c = a * (b * c)
	Commutativity
		a * b = b * a
	Set Closure under operation
		If T \subset S, and t1 * t2 \in T:
		T is closed under *
	Examples: Exponentiation, Addition, Multiplication
	Example: Average (commutative, not associative)

Group
	Identity, Inverse, Associative
	Example: Z, addition
	Example: {0}, addition
	Example: Positive rationals, mult
	Example: Functions, composition
	Counterexample: Strings

	Problems (ask these of the students):
		{1}, multiplication
		nonzero Q, multiplication
		Q, addition
		Q, multiplication
		{-1, 1}, multiplication
		{-1, 0, 1}, multiplication
		Z, multiplication
		10Z, addition
		nonzero Q, division
		Z, subtraction


	Prove: Identity is unique
	Prove: Inverses are unique

	{a, b} is a group with identity a -- fill in the Cayley table

Symmetry Group, Permutations
	Scrambles elements
	How many? n!
	These are functions - group operation is composition

Equivalence Relations
	Reflexive: a R a
	Symmetric: a R b -> b R a
	Transitive: a R b and b R c -> a R c
	Partitions the set into equivalence classes

Modular Equivalence
	We say a = b (mod n) if (b-a) is divisible by n
	We can then talk about equivalence classes e.g. [0], [1]

(Z_n, (+)) is a group under "addition"

Order of element in Group
	o(a) = smallest n s.t. a^n = I, or \infty otherwise

Cyclic Groups
	Groups generated by one element
	Example: Z
	Counterexample: {0,1} ^ 2

Rings
	Commutative group with other operation:
	Associative
	Distributive Law
	Example: 2x2 matrices over R(?)
	Example: Z, integers
	Question: Is Z_n a ring?

Fields
	Rings, with:
	Identity
	Commutativity
	No zero divisors
	Inverses
	Example: R
	Example: Z_p
	Example: Complex numbers
	Counterexample: R^2, with pointwise multiplication

	Finite fields basically act like R
